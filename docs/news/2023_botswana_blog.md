# Botswana Blog

## Days 1-3 (6/26 – 6/28) (it really feels like one long day though)
Dumela! We have experienced four different countries, four international airports, three different plane manufacturers, and many accents in 48 hours (pretty much, we’re rounding!). Despite these exciting adventures, here are our top three things we’re excited to have a break from: cramped spaces, airplane food, and sleeping sitting up (or just getting no sleep). Things we’re excited about are: eating more cultural food (Sawar), meeting new people (Sanj), cultural exchange (Kaitlin), seeing cool animals (Brianna), seeing the sunrise (Ollie), sharing STEM (Guinness). When we finally landed in Maun, we were kindly picked up by a member of the Tshilli Farm who drove us 45 minutes (after patiently waiting for us to figure out luggage out) to the farm where we’re staying. During the drive, so many kids who were walking home from their school day waved and shouted to greet us. Everyone has been incredibly welcoming and hospitable, and we’ve only gotten a taste of Botswana. We will be updating this blog as frequently as we can and you’ll next be hearing about our safari adventures!
