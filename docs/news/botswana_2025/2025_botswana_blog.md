# Botswana Blog - 2025

## Day -2 (7/10)

3 days 'til we go to the airport!

We're (mostly) packed and ready for the trip. Reviewing last-minute travel requirements, as well as going over the SPIKE Prime robot code one last time, we had our very last Botswana outreach meeting today.

## Days 1, 2, and 3 (7/13 - 7/15)

We all arrived in time for our flight and got on a plane headed to Doha, Qatar.

The first flight lasted over 15 hours, and we were very tired by the time we got to Doha. We stayed for about 6 hours at the Garden Hotel, and got up at midnight to catch our next flight to Johannesburg.

We are writing this from the Johannesburg OR Tambo International Airport in South Africa, where we saw pigeons.

We still have approximately one hour left of flights before we can reach our apartment in Gabarone, and we plan to stay up until 9:00 PM to help with the jet lag.
