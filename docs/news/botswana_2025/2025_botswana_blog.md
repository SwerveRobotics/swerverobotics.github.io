# Botswana Blog - 2025

## Day -2 (7/10)

3 days 'til we go to the airport!

We're (mostly) packed and ready for the trip. Reviewing last-minute travel requirements, as well as going over the SPIKE Prime robot code one last time, we had our very last Botswana outreach meeting today.

## Days 1, 2, and 3 (7/13 - 7/15)

We all arrived at the airport with enough time to check bags, get through security without issue, and grabbed some overpriced airport food. When we finally sat down on the plane we had to settle in for a long (15-hour) flight.

![Group photo in the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport](botswana_images/Johannesburg%20Airport.jpg)

The first flight lasted over 15 hours, and we were very tired by the time we got to Doha, 24 hours later. We were lucky enough to have a long enough layover before our next flight to get hotel rooms for a quick rest. We stayed for about 6 hours at the Garden Hotel inside the Doha airport — getting some much-needed, if short, sleep — and got up at midnight to catch our next flight to Johannesburg.

We are currently writing this from the Johannesburg OR Tambo International Airport in South Africa, after an 8-hour flight from Doha. Hanging out in the terminal with us are pigeons. We aren't sure how they got here, but we appreciate the company.

### Edit from Day 4 (7/16):

We had approximately one hour left of flying before we get to the Sir Seretse Khama International Airport, named after the first president of Botswana.

![Sir Seretse Khama International Airport Sign](botswana_images/Gaborone%20Airport.jpg)

Exhausted but excited, we stayed up until 9:00 PM in order to combat jet lag and get ourselves set up better for the next two weeks.

## Day 4 (7/16)

Everyone woke up at different times today, so we had a nice, chill morning, and we all had fun on our breakfast adventures. Eric and Rob woke up early for a morning run, while Emlyn and Bharvi woke up around 9:00. Everyone starting trickling into the breakfast area where we debated what constituted a sandwich versus a toast, Bharvi made her morning chai, and Eric attempted to flip an egg without a spatula... (spoiler alert - it didn't go well!) 

After breakfast and showers, we were informed that we needed to build a FLL field for the cultural exhange we have tomorrow. The rest of our morning went by with Eric doing some coding, the rest of us building various LEGO model missions, and Heidi writing a bio for her speech tomorrow. It started out theraputic, but we ended up with only 3 missons complete before it was time for lunch.  

![Group photo building LEGO missions](botswana_images/LEGO%20mission%20building.jpg)

For lunch we enjoyed a nice meal at a restaurant in the local mall before heading to a small grocery store to pick up some food for lunch tomorrow. We saw an automatic bread slicer!

![An automatic bread slicer](botswana_images/Bread%20cutter.jpg)

We then went back to the AirBNB to do even more LEGO building and SPIKE Prime robot coding before heading out to a nice dinner with Heidi's cousin — the top lawyer in Botswana! — and his wife (this was also at the mall).

![Orange drink with a slice of orange](botswana_images/Orange%20drink.jpg)

Just for funsies, Bharvi and Emlyn tried some mocktails, and so did Heidi, but of course Emlyn didn't know this when Heidi first offered her to try her drink, and she was rather concerned. One of us actually had a fun drink at lunch called "Malawi Shandy" which was a combination of lemonade and "Stoney", a popular and very strong ginger beer in Botswana, and it was throughly enjoyed.

![Group photo in the Two Six Seven Restaurant](botswana_images/267%20Restaurant.jpg)

All tired, we drove home to bed, but not before finishing the last of the LEGO work.

## Day 5 (7/17)

The morning started off slow again today with people trickling in as they woke up. Eric and Rob went for a morning run, while Heidi walked, and Sara, Emlyn, Hank, and Bharvi held down the fort at the AirBNB. Since we had to leave at noon, the morning was spent grazing as there wasn't much time to get lunch and we had plenty of food from the store. The morning was also spent — somewhat frantically — coding the robot for the cultural exchange later.

![Coding the SPIKE Prime robot in preparation for the cultural exchange](botswana_images/SPIKE%20Prime%20robot%20coding.jpg)

We left just after noon for the cultural exchange event, stopping at the Dare to Dream office first to go over plans. We then drove to the Mogoditshane Senior Secondary School, a upper-ages high-school equivalent, but we also had younger students visiting from the other Mogoditshane Junior Secondary School campus. Of these schools' 1,800 students, we met with around 55 of them in their auditorium. The cultural exchange event began with some speeches, from the schools' leadership, from Dare to Dream founder Captain Kgomotso Phatsima, and even from our very own Heidi. Afterwards, we were treated to a traditional dance. We learned later that this was the group's first time performing the dance, but you would never have been able to tell that it was because they seemed so confident and well-rehearsed. Afterwards, we began to talk with the students. While at first everyone was nervous, since we and the students of Mogoditshane Senior and Junior Secondary School were quiet with nerves, eventually we all got more comfortable and the conversation began to flow.

![Mogoditshane Senior Secondary School Dance Club](botswana_images/Traditional%20dance.jpg)

First, we ran through the basics of FLL robotics: the game, the innovation project, and core values. We made sure to emphasize that in FIRST, robotics is more than just technical skills: it is about leadership, communication, and so much more. The students seemed interested in the program, asking loads of questions about what coding language we used and how the game worked.

![Eric explaining in the Mogoditshane Senior Secondary School](botswana_images/Eric%20explaining.jpg)

![Emlyn explaining there](botswana_images/Emlyn%20explaining.jpg)

After going over FLL, we wanted to learn more about each other's cultures. At first we had group question time, where they asked us questions about America, the school system, the culture, and the weather. The students seemed amazed when we revealed that we were only 15-18 years old and not in our 20s like they expected or thought we were. On the other hand, we asked about their school system, their traditions, and much more. We bonded over our shared experieces of the joys of math in school and were baffled by each other's weather (although Fahrenheit-Celsius conversions had to be made).

![Group photo in the Mogoditshane Senior Secondary School](botswana_images/Mogoditshane%20cultural%20exchange%20group%20picture.jpg)

We then split up to talk to smaller groups, opening up for questions people were too shy to ask in person. Many photos were taken and many questions were asked. Some students stayed an extra 30+ minutes just to ask more questions. Eric was able to go over his code in more depth, even demonstrating Python and more complex coding aspects, while Emlyn fielded more questions about life in America, universities, and leadership. Hank and Bharvi worked together, further explaining the FLL program and spreading the joy of robotics.

![Hank explaining in the Mogoditshane Senior Secondary School](botswana_images/Hank%20explaining.jpg)

![Bharvi explaining there](botswana_images/Bharvi%20explaining.jpg)

Exhausted, we loaded back into the van and went to dinner. While traveling, we saw cows!

![Cows in a upholstery stall](botswana_images/Cows.jpg)

Bharvi was desperate for food other than just hamburgers and fries (honestly, we all were), and so we found a restaurant with a wide variety of food including curry, paneer, ribs, kebab, and so much more, which everyone was able to enjoy. Bharvi enjoyed the food a lot, but not enough to stay awake, accidentally falling asleep at the table. It was possibly a food-induced coma, or maybe it was just from the day's hard work.

![Bharvi in a food-induced coma](botswana_images/Bharvi%20sleeping.jpg)

## Day 6 (7/18)

We started the day very early because we supposedly had a flight to catch at 8. Eric and Emlyn woke up at 5:45 and everyone else woke up at 6:00-ish. We rushed to get out the door, seeing the sunrise on the way, and were somehow still late, although that ended up not mattering because our flight was delayed till 9:30. However, this meant that we got to enjoy a nice breakfast at the airport, some of us even having carrot cake with our meal. Eric, Heidi, and Emlyn all had breakfast bagels. Eric says his was rather egg-like. 

![The sunrise in Botswana](botswana_images/Sunrise.jpg)

When it was finally close enough to 9:00 we got through security right in time to begin boarding, but not before taking a photo with a wooden elephant sculpture. While in line for boarding, Eric and Hank were informed that their seats were moved and that they had to go to the back because they were "big guys" and the plane needed to be balanced. 

![A wooden elephant sculpture](botswana_images/Elephant%20sculpture.jpg)

The flight itself was gorgeous. We flew over the stunning landscape of Botswana from south to north. The highlight of the flight was seeing the Makgadikgadi Pan. While we were origanally supposed to see the salt flats in-person and we won't get to do that, flying over them was still a wonderful view.

![Makgadikgadi Pan salt flats](botswana_images/Salt%20flats.jpg)

Once we landed, we grabbed our bags, got a bite to eat, and headed to our hotel to drop our bags and head to the border. Our drive to the Botswana-Zimbabwe border was in an open-sided safari van, so we enjoyed a strong breeze while hoping to spot wildlife. Even though we thought we had pre-applied for visas to get into Zimbabwe, we still had to re-do everything, and even then some of us ran into more trouble with passports. Baboons entertained us with their antics as the rest of us were waiting, and after some troubleshooting, we passed through into Zimbabwe.

![Baboon at the Botswana-Zimbabwe border](botswana_images/Baboon.jpg)

After reaching Zimbabwe, we realized that there was some confusion among the tours that we had booked, and we had to switch drivers. Finally, we reached Victoria Falls. It was absolutely gorgeous and we realized why it was one of the natural wonders of the world. Our favorite site was the first viewpoint, with a rainbow and a part of the falls. We all got drenched halfway through(especially Eric!) and enjoyed the sun as we dried off. 

![Widest portion of Victoria Falls](botswana_images/Victoria%20Falls%20wide.jpg)

![Looking down into the chasm](botswana_images/Victoria%20Falls%20narrow.jpg)

![Group photo at Victoria Falls](botswana_images/Victoria%20Falls%20group%20photo.jpg)

After we finished the falls, we had to rush to the border in order to we reach there before it was closed. By this point, we were all starving and finally got some food in our systems as well as bought some water. We drove to the hotel and ate dinner together. At the end of the day, we all met up in Bharvi and Emlyn's room to hang out, write this blog, and finish off the day. 

## Day 7 (7/19)

We started our day at 8:00 with a breakfast of plenty of toast, eggs, and cereal. Then we made our way to the safari camp where we were treated to some delicous mango fruit drinks upon arrival, informed about the rest of our stay, and scared away from talking to the lions. After a quick game of cards, we were shown to our rooms and took in the gorgeous view of the Chobe River.

![A view of the river](botswana_images/Chobe_River.jpg)

Then we returned to the common area for lunch. Eric, antsy to get moving and forbidden from running around the camp, instigated a trip to the pool. Eric discoverd the pool was far too small, cold, and bug-filled to get any substantial exercise, but we all still sat and enjoyed the sun on our shoulders and the water on our feet. After meeting up for high tea, we headed out on our safari for the first day.

![Atop a tree by the pool](<botswana_images/Tree boy.jpg>)

We met our guide and hopped on a open-backed truck before starting to explore the bush. We started by heading towards the river. On the way we met a group of baboons eating some of the thick underbrush.

![Baboons frolicking](botswana_images/Monkey.jpg)

We had expected to have to search for animals, but once we got to the river, they were plentiful. It seemed like we were stopping every few feet to look at a new animal. We spotted giraffes, antelope, impala, zebra and even an elephant. We even saw a real-life zebra crossing! We also saw a crocodile, but only the very top of its head.

![Graffe by the tree](botswana_images/Giraffes.jpg)

![Out for a walk](<botswana_images/Out for a walk.jpg>)

![Impala spotting](botswana_images/Impala.jpg)

Before it got too late, we headed away from the river in search of the elusory leopard. Unfortunately, we weren't so lucky, but we maintain the hope of seeing it tomorrow morning when we leave at 6:30. Eventually, we stopped for a well-needed snack. Our guide was prepared and brought out drinks for the adults and juices for the kids, as well as naan and hummus as a snack. We watched the sunset while enjoying our small meal.

![A quick break](botswana_images/Breaking.jpg)

On the way back to the camp, we watched the changing colors of the sky while being struck by incoming bugs.

![The setting of the sun](botswana_images/Sunset.jpg)

## Day 8 (7/20)

We started out our day before the sun. We weren't allowed to traverse the camp in the dark by ourselves, so our guide came to take us to the common area at 6:00. After finishing our breakfast of cereal, toast, and muffins that were rather like cupcakes, we headed out on our second game drive.

We were able to watch the sun rise as we entered the national park, seeing out first elephant of the day. However, we had our sights set on only one thing: a leopard. Our spectacular guide Isaac took us to where he thought there would most likely be a leopard. On the way we saw giraffes, of which there seemed to be endless numbers.

![A giraffe sating its thirst](<botswana_images/Giraffe drinking.jpg>)

While the group stopped on the edge of the river for some coffee, tea, and shortbread cookies, we were approached by monkeys who were attempting to steal anything they could. However, our guide chased them away. They were very silly monkeys, jumping around from tree to tree and from safari van to safari van. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our morning treat before heading off on our adventure again.

![Velvet monkey on a truck](<botswana_images/Truck monkey.jpg>)

In between our morning drinks and lunch were the big cats (and also big elephants). First, Isaac took us to where he had heard there had been lions. While they were a little hard to see, we could still see them curled up under a tree. After leaving, we came across a herd of elephants heading towards the river for a drink. We passed them and started to wait for them to arrive. While waiting, Coach Sara turned and was confronted with a leopard slinking between bushes. We followed along, catching glimpses of it when it passed gaps in the foliage, before we finally lost sight of it as it went up a tree. We pulled off the road to get a better view, and watched it survey the terrain, looking for prey.

![A group of elephants drinking in a line](<botswana_images/Line drinking.jpg>)

![A leopard looking for prey on a branch](<botswana_images/Cat tree.jpg>)

After a little while longer of viewing the wildlife, we drove to our lunch spot back by the monkeys to enjoy a nice lunch of pasta, salad, bread, and an assortment of crackers and cheeses. We spoke to a lovely family also on the trip that were from the UK. They were telling us about the pygmy goats they had waiting for them upon their arrival home. After packing up our lunch, we headed back out into the bush.

![Bharvi and Emlyn looking at something with Eric in the background using binoculars](<botswana_images/Sight seeing.jpg>)

In the period of time after lunch but before the cruise, we saw some of our first hippos of the day. Although they hid quickly by dipping under the water, we were still able to get a fairly good look at them, though this was made more difficult by the fact that we had seven people and one pair of binoculars. We sped along the riverside for another couple hours before heading to the dock where we would launch our river cruise.

![A hippo walking on land](botswana_images/Hippo.jpg)

![Elephants wading in the river](botswana_images/Crossing.jpg)

The cruise started with us peering at the many many water-skaters that graced the surface of the water. From there, we enjoyed the flood plains and its many animals. Eric was very excited to see the crocodiles from much closer, as earlier they were only visble from farther away, but by far, the highlight of the river cruise were the birds. They ranged from small, like the king fisher, to huge, like the fish eagle. The fish eagles were the photography gold of the day, with everyone on the boat simply having to snap a photo. After about two hours, we headed back to shore and back into the truck. We rode home rather quickly but made sure to stop for the water buffalo, which we hadn't yet seen on our trip.

![A fish eagle perched atop a tree](botswana_images/Observing.jpg)

![A crocodile chilling in the sun](<botswana_images/Chilling in the sun.jpg>)

When we made it back, we had about an hour of rest time to watch the sun set and to relax a bit after our long day.

## Day 9 (7/21)

Today started just as yesterday did: at 5:30 in the morning. Breakfast was almost the same, except the muffins had raisins this time, and there was oatmeal. We ate quickly and set off on our journey. Our wonderful guide had heard rumors of a cheetah roaming around before the entrance to the park, so we raced over to see it. On the way there, a whole herd of elephants crossed the road in front of us, so we got to stop and watch the parade go by before continuing in search of the cheetah. After a fair amount of driving, we saw in the distance a bunch of the safari vans crowded around the side of the road. As we drove up, we could just barely see the cheetah, but our driver was able to navigate to a better viewing point. The cheetah was walking along the side of the road, marking its scent, and climbing in trees. We were in awe of its agility and coat pattern and watched it for quite a while before actually going into the park.

![Elephants crossing the road](<botswana_images/Crossing the road.jpg>)

![Cheetah smelling the base of a tree](<botswana_images/Smelling the smells.jpg>)

![Cheetah lying down in the grasses](<botswana_images/Just napping.jpg>)

Today was a cloudy day, so many of the creatures were hiding. This meant that most of what we enjoyed today (at least for the first few hours of the drive) was the landscape. This was more than okay, though, because the clouds gave a completely new look to our surroundings, and also reminded us a bit of home, although no rain fell. We stopped for coffee, tea, and cookies again this morning, and they were more valued today due to the chillier weather.

![An overcast sky](<botswana_images/Cloudy day>)

We took off again in search of the hidden creatures, even going so far as to follow the lions' tracks till they led into the bushes where we couldn't go. Even so, Sara was adamant about seeing lions, and so we continued the search. It was only when Isaac said we had to start heading out of the park that we finally got to see the lions. Through a little off-roading, we managed to get right up near a mother, some teens, and some young ones the guide said were between 3 and 6 months old. Some of the teens were playing around, pawing, and biting each other. Eventually, the mother lion got up and walked away, either to look for food or because she was tired of her kids' shenanigans. The mother lion ended up walking right in front of our vehicle, seemingly unbothered by us.

![Mother lion stretching after a good nap](<botswana_images/After a good nap.jpg>)

![A group of young lions, one pawing at another](<botswana_images/Playing around.jpg>)

We drove back to the lodge where we got a couple free hours, broken up by a lovely lunch including kebabs, pasta, and salad, which we all enjoyed at our leisure before taking off to either shower, nap, or whatever else we wanted. Then came high tea, with delicious chocolate banana cake and some hair braiding in preparation for our second safari of the day. Shortly after 3:30, we were on the trail again. Our guide took us to the other side of the park, which we hadn’t seen yet. We got to see a dried-up water hole where we learned about animal trails and tracks.

![Track from giraffe](<botswana_images/Giraffe track.jpg>)

We took various photos of the gorgeous landscape, with an especially wonderful one of antelope, giraffes and elephants all in one frame around the water hole with a sunset in the background. Later, we saw a large group of ants marching out of their mound and some warthogs. We didn't see many new animals, but the landscape was stunning and the safari was almost like a scenic drive. 

After that we stopped for some beverages and snacks with a gorgeous view. We all enjoyed various drinks and continued driving.

![Ants marching out of mound](<botswana_images/Ants.jpg>)

On the way back to the camp, we saw a huge herd of elephants crossing our path, and saw a car almost crash into an antelope. After some leisure time and teaching some of the staff about robotics, it was time for dinner. We had butternut soup and white bread rolls. Then, we had eggplant lasagna and roast beef, with roasted potatoes and cucumbers. We had some fun times trying the interesting cauliflower cheese. The chef very kindly made special lactose-free pasta for Eric, who very much enjoyed the meals. Finally, our day ended with Emlyn and Eric retiring for the night and Hank and Bharvi finishing the blog. Overall, it was a fun but tiring day!

![Huge herd of elephants](<botswana_images/Elephant herd.jpg>)

## Day 10 (7/22)

In comparison with the last few days, today was rather slow. We slept until 7:00 and started packing to prepare for breakfast at 8:00. After we finished eating, we loaded into a van and headed to the airport to catch our flight back to Gaborone. Due to lack of demand for the direct route, our flight was moved to a quick connection in Maun and then on to Gaborone. We didn't even have to leave the plane! We used the rest of the trip to settle in for some well-deserved sleep.

![Over Gaborone](<botswana_images/Over Gaborone.jpg>)

Once we landed, we reclaimed our bags, rebooked our rental car, and headed out in search of food. For our late lunch, we got burgers at the same place we did the first day, but this time we were more adventurous with our food.

![Good burger](<botswana_images/Good burger.jpg>)

After we finished, we headed to the grocery store to stock up on provisions then back to the Airbnb. For the rest of the day, we napped, read, and in the case of the girls, held a slumber party.

## Day 11 (7/23)

The morning was a confusing period. We had gone to bed the night before without a plan and shockingly when we woke up, there was still no plan. Luckily the adults worked it all out, after multiple plans were made, scraped, made again, and scraped again. We finally worked out a plan to go get lunch, do some souvenir shopping, and make our way to our meeting with Dare To Dream at 2:30. 

With a plan now actually in place, we drove to Botswana Craft, a resturant-giftstore location where did enacted both the lunch and the souvenir shopping aspects of our plan. The resturant offered both Botswana classics and more traditional american cuisine. Oxtail, grilled 1/4 chicken with tradional spices, and some sort of bean meal, were are tasted and enjoyed by more adventurous members of the group. While others enjoyed pizza and chicken burgers more in their comfort zones. Either way the food was good. 

An interesting and new experience for us was that just after we had ordered our food, our server came around with a bucket of hot soapy water and a big bowl. We had to put our hands over the bowl while the server poured the water over our hands to clean them. While the experience was new for everyone, it wasn't unpleasant, and left us with clean hands ready to yet our meals with. 

![Eating at Botswana Craft](<botswana_images/Botswana Craft restaurant.jpg>)

After eating we walked to the store area of Botswana craft. Lots and lots of browsing ensued and after like an hour all of our souvenirs had been purchased. Eric wanted to purchase a decorative ostrich egg but was informed via a conviently placed sign by said eggs that the Botswana equivalent of the Department of Fish and Wildlife aren't always thrilled with the eggs being taken out of the country so one might have to make a visit to their office and get a permit. With that knowlegde, Eric's hopes of getting a decorative Ostrich egg were dashed. Everyone wound up back at the car and we headed to the Dare To Dream office at the Innovation Hub to have a planning meeting for our Embassy event on Friday.

Our meeting was incredibly productive. We went in with absolutley no idea what was actually going to be happening at the Embassy, and left with some idea of what was going to be happening at the Embassy, and a lot of homework. With that in mind we made a quick trip to the store to grab supplies for the event and supplies for dinner. So while the students worked on things for the Embassy (and played some uno) the adults prepared a lovely dinner of spaghetti (with three different sauce options), salad, and garlic bread. Even after dinner we got back to work, planning for the next day, and for the Embassy the day after that. Though with an early start the next day, things wrapped up pretty quick (except for the laundary which sat on "1 minute left" for like 5 mintues).

![Group photo at a table with an FLL MASTERPIECE mat and mission modules](<botswana_images/Working around the table.jpg>)

## Day 12 (7/24)

With a hard deadline of being out of the AirBNB at 8:30 people were up and running (some literally) rather early with people waking up between 6:30 and 7:45. Breakfast was mostly fend for your self but Rob was nice enough to make scrambeld eggs for several of us before we had to head out the door.

When we first got to Dare To Dream, we reviewed yesterday's plan before getting to work. Eric and Emlyn worked on writing their introduction to FIRST and FLL speech, while Bharvi worked a website, and Hank worked on a program to showcase at the event. 

Eventually students from a local FLL school team showed up to work with us. After introductions and explanations, we split into groups with the student to work on prepartions for the event. We decided that for a portion of the event we would split into stations with one Swerve student and one Botswana student per station. The stations are going to be a robot game demo, a code it your self area, an innovation project station, and a core values station. The hope is to engage the adults in hands on activities to build excitment for the program. This preparation took up most of the rest of the day with inter group collaboration and fun.

![A few people around a MASTERPIECE field with a robot](<botswana_images/Coding the robot.jpg>)

At 3:15 we left to have our site visit at the Embassy. We went to plan out the location of tables and chairs and other such logistics. Before heading back to the AirBNB to work more in preparation for tommorrow.
