We are currently on our last day of safari and have been seeing incredible wildlife during game drives, cooking with the skilled gourmet chefs in the kitchen, and learning about Botswana\u2019s culture. We have been blown away by the amazing hospitality that we have been received with at the safari, from the head chef Siya expertly meeting all our dietary needs, to our guide Piet sharing stories from his culture and teaching us about the animals on game drives. In our down time, we have been rehearsing our presentations for our three-day FLL camp which we will host in Maun in a couple days. On our last day, to help practice and share, we had the opportunity to work with the staff members at the camp and teach them a little about FLL while we waited for our plane to arrive. We are so grateful to be able to experience such an abundant and beautiful ecosystem, and learn from extremely skilled staff. Below are some photos and stories we heard and encountered during our stay.</p>"},{"location":"news/botswana_2023/2023_botswana_blog.html#stories","title":"Stories*:","text":"<p>We asked one of the guides, Tizzar, how he became so knowledgeable about the land and wildlife, and he explained that from the age of six, he tended to his family\u2019s free-range goats, and would need to follow each member of the herd all throughout the day. On a hot day, he and his cousin were out with the goats. They fell asleep when the goats stopped to rest and woke up to find they were gone! Losing his family\u2019s goats would have been disastrous, and this was the first time he and his cousin had to track animals, with no one having taught him about the land or how to navigate it. He eventually tracked them all the way home, no goat casualties! Tizzar told us that he learned about the wildlife through all his experiences growing up in rural Botswana, but that kids today are more disconnected from nature due to technology. Hearing about this helped put into perspective how dependent on technology and sheltered our childhoods have been. This in comparison to someone who is so in tune with the intricacies of the natural world where they can distinguish between 50 different goat kids and match them to each of their mothers (that\u2019s Tizzar!). (Kaitlin wrote this!)</p> <p>Piet, our safari guide, shared a cultural concept in Botswana about the relationship between twins. They say that the younger twin pushes the older twin out of the womb to meet the sun. It is then believed that the younger twin is the protector of the older one. This explains the shield that each twin has for each other and how they both always have each other\u2019s backs. We, Sawar and Sanj, relate to this as twins, and how we have love for each other for eternity. (Guess who wrote this!)</p> <p>Our guide, Piet, showed us one of the only baobab trees in the area (there are only two!). He explained how it is the biggest tree in Africa and how it can grow to an incredible 60 square meters at the base. He told us about how the tree can grow for hundreds of years, and how the inside layers will eventually dry out and create a hollow space inside the tree. There was even a tree so large it was used as a prison a long time ago. (Ollie wrote this!)</p> <p>When we spotted a herd of zebras, our guide Piet told us that the national animal of Botswana is the zebra. He explained how a politician from Botswana traveled to Britain to study abroad. In the royal court he got to know the princess and they got married. At the time, interracial marriage was considered unacceptable. However they later made Botswana an independent country in 1966 and chose the zebra as the national animal since their black and white stripes represent the end of apartheid in southern Africa and people living in peace regardless of their race.

We taught them the basics such as how the LEGO part system works, how to code, create a research project (the innovation project), how to embrace core values, and utilize design principles. When we arrived on the first day of camp, we were a bit befuddled as none of the FLL mission models had been built yet.\u00ad With little time on the clock, no wi-fi access, and the coding software missing from the laptops provided, we got to work. This also gave us the opportunity to pull our three students into the process of field set up because we realized they too will have to go through these steps eventually. With the help from the students, we got everything set up with time to get into presentations. They were excited to get started working with robots as we returned to our regularly scheduled programming (pun intended!). As they learned to build and code their robots, we could see their interest start to grow.

With them having missed a third of the camp, we quickly put them into teams, provided pre-built robots, and caught them up as we moved on to the research project, engineering process, and mechanisms presentations. In their teams, they brainstormed research project ideas and solutions, following the engineering design process. After that, we gave a quick rundown on game strategy again to refresh and introduce the topic to others. From that, they could pick missions they wanted to complete and begin building attachments and programming their robots. We spent the latter part of the day working with them one on one to help strengthen their understanding through hands-on experiences (we had to pry them away from the robots during breaks!). Among other things, we taught teams to use rack and pinion mechanisms and how to make simple line following programs, making sure they understood foundational principles beforehand. Each team faced entirely unique problems and all of us were working hard helping them solve these throughout the day. The room was filled with cheers and high fives every time a team completed a mission. This was the most impactful part of the camp for both us and them.

After presentations were finished, we let teams begin working on their robots to finish any last minute changes before the competition. Young students also came to join us today, providing an interesting challenge of teams nearly doubling in size, educating the students, and bringing them into the teams. It was impressive how quickly they learned the coding and design concepts required for FLL. It was comforting to see how well the teachers that we taught were able to guide the younger students through all the content we had covered in the past two days. Because of this, we can rest easy knowing they will make excellent FLL coaches and leaders of STEM. After lunch, we had our competition where teams each presented to everyone their research project. The teachers had engaged the secondary school students to the point where some even ran the robot during the robot game and presented their team\u2019s project.

We started off on rough footing as many of us had only found out the day prior that we would be presenting. Furthermore, we were late. An hour late. When we finally arrived, we entered a large auditorium with a stage at the front, over 50 chairs in the audience rows, and two FLL tables near the back, out of the way. There were so many school kids here and they were already messing around with their robots on the fields. Everyone was called over to the audience chairs and then we started the opening ceremonies with Rethabile from Dare to Dream. She first introduced guests such as two tribe chiefs representing their support of the program and other heads sitting at the table (Rob, Heidi, and Phatsima included). We then moved onto the many presentations. Local staff and community leaders spoke on how FLL impacted their communities for the better. FLL team coaches invited students from their teams to share about how FLL impacted them personally. It was truly inspiring to hear how they grew through the program. For our presentations, Heidi had her first keynote speech today! We presented on what FLL means to us, game strategy, robot design principles, core values, the innovation project, and coding practices. In between presentations from leaders of the local community, we had various forms of breaks through a stand-up poem in a native language and traditional dance as part of the cultural exchange.</p> <p>After all the formalities had finished, we broke for lunch and to students demonstrating their robots. We then got the opportunity to have more intimate conversations with them about who they were, what they were interested in, and how we can help them better understand more complex FLL concepts. We spent a lot of time talking to them about how to use sensors, as their robots, while quite good (as evidenced by the 9 trophies they had on display), could be improved with the usage of color sensors and the gyro sensor. We also showed them the importance of using jigs to line their robots up as we noticed they were just counting squares. We\u2019re just imagining the number of trophies they could be bringing back when they start implementing the advice we gave them. Before we said a solemn goodbye, we made sure to share contact information so we can remain involved in their journey through FLL and life. We all agreed being able to teach and talk with those kids was probably the most fun we\u2019ve had in this entire trip.</p> <p>Afterwards, we went to this place called RoccoMomma where they served American style food with American style portions.

On Saturday we ate lunch at Botswana Craft and went shopping for some souvenirs. The restaurant there offered Setswana style food and then proceeded to serve some of the most tender lamb, goat, and shredded beef. Also, the chicken nuggets tasted like the ones from Costco and Brianna felt like she was back in Washington (yippee). Then Sanj and Sawar had veggie burgers for the third time this trip. Afterwards, we got to meet Heidi\u2019s cousins in Ramotswa (about 30 mins from Gaborone). It was so lovely to finally get to meet them after hearing Heidi\u2019s story about how she wanted to bring robotics to Botswana because she had family here. When that was finished, we all went for dinner at this grand chicken place called Nando\u2019s. They had some of the most delightful dishes and it was quite fun. The next day, we went to Botswana\u2019s International Museum to learn more about local culture. The museum was unfortunately closed for renovation, but we walked through and perused the art gallery! We saw some of the most unique and well-made art pieces, and a lot of them were going for ridiculously low prices, which made it all more tempting to pool our money and buy all of them to hang up at the shop. Afterwards, we went to an Indian restaurant called Chutney and we were unsure of what the serving portions were, but Sawar and Sanj did a great job leading us to a tasty victory. That evening, we went (very safely, I might add) to visit the Innovation Hub and built all the mission models to prepare for the training camp the next day.

It was nice to arrive finding the FLL fields already assembled and arranged. We also had a little moment of relief as we discovered we could use the four spike prime core kits we brought with us (instead of the Mindstorms kits Dare to Dream got from Toys R\u2019 Us). As teachers began to arrive, we realized we would have a much fuller house on our first day than last time. We counted 10 people total on our first day and broke them into teams of two and three. We started off with our normal presentation schedule. We were not prepared for the teachers to get into the technical bits so quickly as we hadn\u2019t even taught the coding portion when teams were already trying to complete missions. This was a grand contrast to our experience in Maun, but we adapted and taught a more accelerated course by increasing complexity of the topics covered. By the end of today, most teams had already completed simple push missions. Towards the end of the day, Michael, the director of the Duba Plains safari company, paid us a visit with his children to learn about our work and connect with Dare to Dream! We taught his kids how to program a robot and it was a great opportunity to connect with local kids to teach them robotics (Brianna taught Michael\u2019s daughter how to create designs with the robot\u2019s lights and dance in a circle!).</p>"},{"location":"news/botswana_2023/2023_botswana_blog.html#day-15","title":"Day 15","text":"<p>Today is the second day of camp.

Afterwards, we had a core values activity then went on to Guinness\u2019s mechanisms presentation. They began to build with great interest after learning core design principles and then continued to complete more of the complex missions. They had the rest of the day to work on their robots and most teams had completed three missions by the end of today.

We were greeted by Captain Phatsima and we were given a tour of the innovation hub which turns out to be just one very large well-crafted donut with multiple layers (it actually looks more like three curved maple bars but it felt like a donut. Lots of long hallways is all). Some points of notability during the tour were the gardens outside, the number of different companies and workspaces that resided within, and the large spiral staircase. It all mostly seemed to be under construction, but it was still pretty cool to walk about and see everything. After that, we returned to the training room where we began to set up. Media representatives soon arrived with large camera equipment and microphones. We were then interviewed about what FIRST is, what we\u2019re doing for the camp, and the purpose of it all. They were intrigued at the sight of all the LEGO robots and the fields, so we offered to teach them some coding and took them through some basic robot control exercises. This only fueled their interest and as a product we may just have gotten two more advocates for the FIRST program in Botswana. We kicked off today with a presentation on FLL competitions and judging, then let them move on to work time to prepare for the competition. After lunch, we started competition with a core values activity where participants tried to instruct their teammates blindly to build a LEGO model. Then, we proceeded to the innovation project presentations. In comparison to the Maun camp these presentations were more detailed (likely due to more time available) and teams this time had materials to create posters to describe their project. Once presentations wrapped up, we started our robot game competition. This was a true demonstration of how quickly these teachers learned. Many had three missions reliably and one even had five (cough cough team fly). In the end, everyone\u2019s performances were very impressive with the top score reaching 175 points. Wild! It was great having everyone there participating, we even drew in the camera man from the media group and the two representatives from the ministry of education. We wrapped everything up with a nice closing ceremony with a few final remarks from Dare to Dream, coaches in training, and us (very emotional!!). Another thing to note, we all were given Setswana names by the camera man, Active. There as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Kabo (to gift): Ollie</li> <li>Naledi (star): Sanj</li> <li>One (him/god): Brianna</li> <li>Neo (to gift): Sawar</li> <li>Tiro (work/job): Guinness</li> <li>Mpho (to gift): Kaitlin</li> </ul> <p>This marks the end of our journey as we return to America tomorrow by means of too many long plane rides. It\u2019s been an incredible journey that we all will never forget. We are all exhausted, but we would do this for the country of Botswana again in a heartbeat. Seeing how empowered everyone felt after being given this opportunity to explore STEM was inspiring and we look eagerly on to see what Botswana does next. As this story closes another will begin.

Eric and Rob went for a morning run, while Heidi walked, and Sara, Emlyn, Hank, and Bharvi held down the fort at the AirBNB. Since we had to leave at noon, the morning was spent grazing as there wasn\u2019t much time to get lunch and we had plenty of food from the store. The morning was also spent \u2014 somewhat frantically \u2014 coding the robot for the cultural exchange later.</p> <p></p> <p>We left just after noon for the cultural exchange event, stopping at the Dare to Dream office first to go over plans. We then drove to the Mogoditshane Senior Secondary School, a upper-ages high-school equivalent, but we also had younger students visiting from the other Mogoditshane Junior Secondary School campus. Of these schools\u2019 1,800 students, we met with around 55 of them in their auditorium. The cultural exchange event began with some speeches, from the schools\u2019 leadership, from Dare to Dream founder Captain Kgomotso Phatsima, and even from our very own Heidi. Afterwards, we were treated to a traditional dance. We learned later that this was the group\u2019s first time performing the dance, but you would never have been able to tell that it was because they seemed so confident and well-rehearsed. Afterwards, we began to talk with the students. While at first everyone was nervous, since we and the students of Mogoditshane Senior and Junior Secondary School were quiet with nerves, eventually we all got more comfortable and the conversation began to flow.</p> <p></p> <p>First, we ran through the basics of FLL robotics: the game, the innovation project, and core values. We made sure to emphasize that in FIRST, robotics is more than just technical skills: it is about leadership, communication, and so much more. The students seemed interested in the program, asking loads of questions about what coding language we used and how the game worked.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>After going over FLL, we wanted to learn more about each other\u2019s cultures. At first we had group question time, where they asked us questions about America, the school system, the culture, and the weather. The students seemed amazed when we revealed that we were only 15-18 years old and not in our 20s like they expected or thought we were. On the other hand, we asked about their school system, their traditions, and much more. We bonded over our shared experieces of the joys of math in school and were baffled by each other\u2019s weather (although Fahrenheit-Celsius conversions had to be made).</p> <p></p> <p>We then split up to talk to smaller groups, opening up for questions people were too shy to ask in person. Many photos were taken and many questions were asked. Some students stayed an extra 30+ minutes just to ask more questions. Eric was able to go over his code in more depth, even demonstrating Python and more complex coding aspects, while Emlyn fielded more questions about life in America, universities, and leadership. Hank and Bharvi worked together, further explaining the FLL program and spreading the joy of robotics.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Exhausted, we loaded back into the van and went to dinner. While traveling, we saw cows!</p> <p></p> <p>Bharvi was desperate for food other than just hamburgers and fries (honestly, we all were), and so we found a restaurant with a wide variety of food including curry, paneer, ribs, kebab, and so much more, which everyone was able to enjoy. Bharvi enjoyed the food a lot, but not enough to stay awake, accidentally falling asleep at the table. It was possibly a food-induced coma, or maybe it was just from the day\u2019s hard work.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"news/botswana_2025/2025_botswana_blog.html#day-6-718","title":"Day 6 (7/18)","text":"<p>We started the day very early because we supposedly had a flight to catch at 8. Eric and Emlyn woke up at 5:45 and everyone else woke up at 6:00-ish. We rushed to get out the door, seeing the sunrise on the way, and were somehow still late, although that ended up not mattering because our flight was delayed till 9:30. However, this meant that we got to enjoy a nice breakfast at the airport, some of us even having carrot cake with our meal. Eric, Heidi, and Emlyn all had breakfast bagels. Eric says his was rather egg-like. </p> <p></p> <p>When it was finally close enough to 9:00 we got through security right in time to begin boarding, but not before taking a photo with a wooden elephant sculpture. While in line for boarding, Eric and Hank were informed that their seats were moved and that they had to go to the back because they were \u201cbig guys\u201d and the plane needed to be balanced. </p> <p></p> <p>The flight itself was gorgeous. We flew over the stunning landscape of Botswana from south to north. The highlight of the flight was seeing the Makgadikgadi Pan. While we were origanally supposed to see the salt flats in-person and we won\u2019t get to do that, flying over them was still a wonderful view.</p> <p></p> <p>Once we landed, we grabbed our bags, got a bite to eat, and headed to our hotel to drop our bags and head to the border. Our drive to the Botswana-Zimbabwe border was in an open-sided safari van, so we enjoyed a strong breeze while hoping to spot wildlife. Even though we thought we had pre-applied for visas to get into Zimbabwe, we still had to re-do everything, and even then some of us ran into more trouble with passports. Baboons entertained us with their antics as the rest of us were waiting, and after some troubleshooting, we passed through into Zimbabwe.</p> <p></p> <p>After reaching Zimbabwe, we realized that there was some confusion among the tours that we had booked, and we had to switch drivers. Finally, we reached Victoria Falls. It was absolutely gorgeous and we realized why it was one of the natural wonders of the world. Our favorite site was the first viewpoint, with a rainbow and a part of the falls. We all got drenched halfway through(especially Eric!) and enjoyed the sun as we dried off. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>After we finished the falls, we had to rush to the border in order to we reach there before it was closed. By this point, we were all starving and finally got some food in our systems as well as bought some water. We drove to the hotel and ate dinner together. At the end of the day, we all met up in Bharvi and Emlyn\u2019s room to hang out, write this blog, and finish off the day. </p>"},{"location":"news/botswana_2025/2025_botswana_blog.html#day-7-719","title":"Day 7 (7/19)","text":"<p>We started our day at 8:00 with a breakfast of plenty of toast, eggs, and cereal. Then we made our way to the safari camp where we were treated to some delicous mango fruit drinks upon arrival, informed about the rest of our stay, and scared away from talking to the lions. After a quick game of cards, we were shown to our rooms and took in the gorgeous view of the Chobe River.</p> <p></p> <p>Then we returned to the common area for lunch. Eric, antsy to get moving and forbidden from running around the camp, instigated a trip to the pool. Eric discoverd the pool was far too small, cold, and bug-filled to get any substantial exercise, but we all still sat and enjoyed the sun on our shoulders and the water on our feet. After meeting up for high tea, we headed out on our safari for the first day.</p> <p></p> <p>We met our guide and hopped on a open-backed truck before starting to explore the bush. We started by heading towards the river. On the way we met a group of baboons eating some of the thick underbrush.</p> <p></p> <p>We had expected to have to search for animals, but once we got to the river, they were plentiful. It seemed like we were stopping every few feet to look at a new animal. We spotted giraffes, antelope, impala, zebra and even an elephant. We even saw a real-life zebra crossing! We also saw a crocodile, but only the very top of its head.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Before it got too late, we headed away from the river in search of the elusory leopard. Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t so lucky, but we maintain the hope of seeing it tomorrow morning when we leave at 6:30. Eventually, we stopped for a well-needed snack. Our guide was prepared and brought out drinks for the adults and juices for the kids, as well as naan and hummus as a snack.

We weren\u2019t allowed to traverse the camp in the dark by ourselves, so our guide came to take us to the common area at 6:00. After finishing our breakfast of cereal, toast, and muffins that were rather like cupcakes, we headed out on our second game drive.</p> <p>We were able to watch the sun rise as we entered the national park, seeing out first elephant of the day. However, we had our sights set on only one thing: a leopard. Our spectacular guide Isaac took us to where he thought there would most likely be a leopard. On the way we saw giraffes, of which there seemed to be endless numbers.</p> <p></p> <p>While the group stopped on the edge of the river for some coffee, tea, and shortbread cookies, we were approached by monkeys who were attempting to steal anything they could. However, our guide chased them away. They were very silly monkeys, jumping around from tree to tree and from safari van to safari van. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our morning treat before heading off on our adventure again.</p> <p></p> <p>In between our morning drinks and lunch were the big cats (and also big elephants). First, Isaac took us to where he had heard there had been lions. While they were a little hard to see, we could still see them curled up under a tree. After leaving, we came across a herd of elephants heading towards the river for a drink. We passed them and started to wait for them to arrive. While waiting, Coach Sara turned and was confronted with a leopard slinking between bushes. We followed along, catching glimpses of it when it passed gaps in the foliage, before we finally lost sight of it as it went up a tree. We pulled off the road to get a better view, and watched it survey the terrain, looking for prey.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>After a little while longer of viewing the wildlife, we drove to our lunch spot back by the monkeys to enjoy a nice lunch of pasta, salad, bread, and an assortment of crackers and cheeses. We spoke to a lovely family also on the trip that were from the UK. They were telling us about the pygmy goats they had waiting for them upon their arrival home. After packing up our lunch, we headed back out into the bush.</p> <p></p> <p>In the period of time after lunch but before the cruise, we saw some of our first hippos of the day. Although they hid quickly by dipping under the water, we were still able to get a fairly good look at them, though this was made more difficult by the fact that we had seven people and one pair of binoculars. We sped along the riverside for another couple hours before heading to the dock where we would launch our river cruise.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The cruise started with us peering at the many many water-skaters that graced the surface of the water. From there, we enjoyed the flood plains and its many animals. Eric was very excited to see the crocodiles from much closer, as earlier they were only visble from farther away, but by far, the highlight of the river cruise were the birds. They ranged from small, like the king fisher, to huge, like the fish eagle. The fish eagles were the photography gold of the day, with everyone on the boat simply having to snap a photo. After about two hours, we headed back to shore and back into the truck. We rode home rather quickly but made sure to stop for the water buffalo, which we hadn\u2019t yet seen on our trip.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When we made it back, we had about an hour of rest time to watch the sun set and to relax a bit after our long day.</p>"},{"location":"news/botswana_2025/2025_botswana_blog.html#day-9-721","title":"Day 9 (7/21)","text":"<p>Today started just as yesterday did: at 5:30 in the morning. Breakfast was almost the same, except the muffins had raisins this time, and there was oatmeal. We ate quickly and set off on our journey. Our wonderful guide had heard rumors of a cheetah roaming around before the entrance to the park, so we raced over to see it. On the way there, a whole herd of elephants crossed the road in front of us, so we got to stop and watch the parade go by before continuing in search of the cheetah. After a fair amount of driving, we saw in the distance a bunch of the safari vans crowded around the side of the road. As we drove up, we could just barely see the cheetah, but our driver was able to navigate to a better viewing point. The cheetah was walking along the side of the road, marking its scent, and climbing in trees. We were in awe of its agility and coat pattern and watched it for quite a while before actually going into the park.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Today was a cloudy day, so many of the creatures were hiding. This meant that most of what we enjoyed today (at least for the first few hours of the drive) was the landscape. This was more than okay, though, because the clouds gave a completely new look to our surroundings, and also reminded us a bit of home, although no rain fell. We stopped for coffee, tea, and cookies again this morning, and they were more valued today due to the chillier weather.</p> <p></p> <p>We took off again in search of the hidden creatures, even going so far as to follow the lions\u2019 tracks till they led into the bushes where we couldn\u2019t go. Even so, Sara was adamant about seeing lions, and so we continued the search. It was only when Isaac said we had to start heading out of the park that we finally got to see the lions. Through a little off-roading, we managed to get right up near a mother, some teens, and some young ones the guide said were between 3 and 6 months old. Some of the teens were playing around, pawing, and biting each other. Eventually, the mother lion got up and walked away, either to look for food or because she was tired of her kids\u2019 shenanigans. The mother lion ended up walking right in front of our vehicle, seemingly unbothered by us. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>We drove back to the lodge where we got a couple free hours, broken up by a lovely lunch including kebabs, pasta, and salad, which we all enjoyed at our leisure before taking off to either shower, nap, or whatever else we wanted. Then came high tea, with delicious chocolate banana cake and some hair braiding in preparation for our second safari of the day. Shortly after 3:30, we were on the trail again. Our guide took us to the other side of the park, which we hadn\u2019t seen yet. We got to see a dried-up water hole where we learned about animal trails and tracks.</p> <p></p> <p>We took various photos of the gorgeous landscape, with an especially wonderful one of antelope, giraffes and elephants all in one frame around the water hole with a sunset in the background. Later, we saw a large group of ants marching out of their mound and some warthogs. We didn\u2019t see many new animals, but the landscape was stunning and the safari was almost like a scenic drive. </p> <p>After that we stopped for some beverages and snacks with a gorgeous view. We all enjoyed various drinks and continued driving.</p> <p></p> <p>On the way back to the camp, we saw a huge herd of elephants crossing our path, and saw a car almost crash into an antelope. After some leisure time and teaching some of the staff about robotics, it was time for dinner. We had butternut soup and white bread rolls. Then, we had eggplant lasagna and roast beef, with roasted potatoes and cucumbers. We had some fun times trying the interesting cauliflower cheese. The chef very kindly made special lactose-free pasta for Eric, who very much enjoyed the meals. Finally, our day ended with Emlyn and Eric retiring for the night and Hank and Bharvi finishing the blog.

We had gone to bed the night before without a plan, and, shockingly, when we woke up, there was still no plan. Luckily, the adults worked it all out, but only after multiple plans were made, scrapped, made again, and scrapped again. We finally worked out a plan to go get lunch, do some souvenir shopping, and make our way to our meeting with Dare To Dream at 2:30. </p> <p>With a plan now actually in place, we drove to Botswana Craft, a resturant-giftstore location where we enacted both the lunch and souvenir-shopping aspects of our plan. The resturant offered both traditional Setswana and traditional American cuisine. Oxtail, grilled chicken with traditional spices, and some sort of bean meal were tasted and enjoyed by more adventurous members of the group, while others enjoyed pizza and chicken burgers more in their comfort zones. Either way, the food was good. </p> <p>An interesting and new experience for us was that just after we had ordered our food, our server came around with a jug of hot soapy water and a big bowl. We put our hands over the bowl while the server poured the water over our hands to clean them. While the experience was new for everyone, it wasn\u2019t unpleasant and left us with clean hands ready to eat our meals with. </p> <p></p> <p>After eating, we walked to the store area of Botswana craft. Lots and lots of browsing ensued, and after an hour all of our souvenirs had been purchased. Eric wanted to purchase a decorative ostrich egg but was informed via a conveniently-placed sign by said eggs that the Botswana equivalent of the Department of Fish and Wildlife aren\u2019t always thrilled with the eggs being taken out of the country so one might have to make a visit to their office and get a permit. With that knowledge, Eric\u2019s hopes of getting a decorative ostrich egg were dashed. Everyone wound up back in the car and we headed to the Dare To Dream office at the Innovation Hub to have a planning meeting for our embassy event on Friday.</p> <p>Our meeting was incredibly productive. We went in with absolutely no idea what was actually going to be happening at the U.S. Embassy and left with some idea of what was going to be happening at the embassy (along with a lot of homework). With that in mind we made a quick trip to the store to grab supplies for the event and supplies for dinner. So while the students worked on things for the embassy event (and played some Uno), the adults prepared a lovely dinner of spaghetti (with three different sauce options), salad, and garlic bread. Even after dinner, we got back to work planning for the next day and for the embassy (the day after that), though with an early start the next day, things wrapped up pretty quick (except for the laundry, which remained at \u201c1 minute left\u201d for like 5 minutes).</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"news/botswana_2025/2025_botswana_blog.html#day-12-724","title":"Day 12 (7/24)","text":"<p>With a hard deadline of being out of the AirBNB at 8:30, people were up and running (some literally) rather early, with people waking up between 6:30 and 7:45.

After introductions and explanations, we split into groups with the students to work on preparations for the event. We decided that, for a portion of the event, we would split into stations with one Swerve student and one Botswana student per station. The stations are going to be a robot game demo, a code-it-yourself area, an innovation project station, and a core values station.

On top of that, our escort through the embassy wasn\u2019t there, so we wound up waiting an hour and twenty minutes in the car outside the venue.</p> <p></p> <p>Once we finally made it inside, after the initial hectic-ness of getting settled into the venue, we started splitting up and doing various set-up. We finally met up with the younger kids, and Bharvi and Hank worked on assigning and teaching them various tasks while Emlyn and Eric practiced the script and the older kids from Botswana worked on the coding.

Once the opening prayers and welcome remarks were completed, Emlyn, Eric, Lesire, and Kgyle got up and made their prepared speech. They spoke on the FIRST program and its many aspects: both its technical aspects and its core values. They then each covered how being in a FIRST program had impacted them. The audience seemed impressed, especially after Sara informed them that the students had only met, written, and memorized the speech the day before. After that, we started the panel. This was where a series of guests from different fields (including the lovely Heidi Lovett, a financial expert high up in the management of Nando\u2019s, the founder of the BRAST program, and a representative from the Ministry of Commerce and Innovation) answered questions from our panel facilitator. The panel ran quite long, and some of us were slightly bored.

With time in mind, we began closing remarks, where we heard from the headmaster of the school we met with earlier on the trip. After closing remarks, the audience was free to wander the stations and eat refreshments. The stations garnered a lot of interest, engaging visitors hands-on \u2014 especially the coding and robot demo stations. Lots of connections were made and lots of doors were opened. Hank even worked with one of the kids who taught the ambassador from Ukraine to Botsawna how to code! </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>After the event wound down, everyone was starving, and so we went to a coffee shop called The Daily Grind to eat and debrief. We had some fun with the \u201cIced Spiced Chai Lattes\u201d and kombucha we ordered. Eric had kombucha, and others were curious, tried it, and did not like it. Overall, the consensus was that the event went very well and opened many doors \u2014 but some things could\u2019ve gone better, just as any event goes. We discussed some follow-up steps and improvements for the next time and went home. </p> <p>When we first got back, we realized the door to one of the showers was jammed, plus the light in the bathroom was incredibly dim.

Not because it was bad (the performances and dancers were absolutely mind-blowing), but because we were expecting a more light-hearted dance performance and got a gritty, visceral performance about the true and horrifying story of Segametsi Mogomotsi and the riots that followed her kidnapping and ritualistic murder. The dance was incredibly powerful and left us all feeling a variety of different emotions.</p> <p>Once we\u2019d all gotten through the heavy emotional load of the first act, though, we could appreciate the storyline and the dancers from an artistic perspective, as well as the live sound effects and spotlights. The second act was much lighter but still an important part of Botswana\u2019s history. It was about boys going to work in South African gold mines, partying and dancing, and returning home to their wives and daughters. Most of us absolutely adored the production, and we found out afterwords that the troupe had been invited for the World Dance Festival in South Korea. We also learned at the Vice President of Botswana was in attendance. He was called up onstage after the performance to shake hands with the dancers and the behind-the-scences workers.</p> <p></p> <p>After the performance, we spent some time talking to the dancers and producers, learning more about their program and how to support them. After, we ecided to go to the mall to kill some time, shop, and later have dinner. Unfortunately, we found that the mall was mostly closed because it was Sunday so went for an early dinner instead. We went back to Bukhara, the restaurant we\u2019d been to with Dare to Dream, and had a lovely dinner, with Bharvi getting her Indian food and various shakes and desserts. Finally, we were all exhausted and some of us did some grocery shopping before we went home and wrote the blog, dropped some things off, and killed some time before we all went to sleep in prep for the next day.</p>"},{"location":"news/botswana_2025/2025_botswana_blog.html#day-16-728-and-day-17-729","title":"Day 16 (7/28) and Day 17 (7/29)","text":"<p>This morning started as most of the rest did, with people waking up at various times in preparation for our exit interviews with our photographer Kevin. The hope is that by talking about our experience, we can encourage future groups of students, whether in the US or in Botswana to continue with the program as well as to get closure on the experience for ourselves.</p> <p></p> <p>Then we left to get some last goodbyes with our partners, Dare to Dream. After a long discussion about the future of the program, we were drawn by our stomachs to the mall where we picked up lunch. The first time we had been at that mall, we noticed a very cool special store, but unfortunately, we didn\u2019t get a chance to shop. This grave injustice was rectified immediately! More souvenirs were quickly purchased and we headed to the airport to return our van before 3:00. We had a tea (or juice) party before one last goodbye with Captain Phatsima, the leader of Dare to Dream.</p> <p>Our first flight to Johannesburg was just a quick hour. After we landed Eric\u2019s quest began! After being unable to buy an egg in Gaborone, Eric got his hopes up about being able to purchase one in the airport, once we were safely past customs. SOME of the group didn\u2019t think Eric would be able to make it to his egg in time for the 2:00 hour layover. Once we got through the passport check, we ran through arrivals, anxiously waited for the security line, then sprinted to the prize. A giftshop we know had the eggs. In the end, we managed to secure the egg with plenty of time to spare.</p> <p></p> <p>Once we reached Doha, we had to say goodbye to Bharvi, as she was flying straight to India to intern as a radio jockey! Unfortunately, no one actually knew where we were dropping Bharvi off. Heidi and Bharvi ran up and down the airport three times before finally handing her over to an airport employee who promised to take her to the drop off location. Heidi was able to make it back to the terminal just before the plane started boarding.</p> <p></p> <p>The rest of the trip was relatively uneventful. Once we made it back to Seattle, everyone was ready to reunite with their families, so made some quick goodbyes, before heading for home.</p> <p></p> <p>We\u2019re grateful to all who made the trip possible.</p> <p>Thank you, sponsors and donors. Thank you, Botswana. Thank you, U.S. Embassy. Thank you, Dare To Dream. And, finally, thank you, Swerve Robotics.</p>"},{"location":"teams/teams_fllc.html","title":"Swerve FIRST LEGO League Challenge Teams","text":""},{"location":"teams/teams_fllc.html#fll-2797","title":"FLL 2797","text":"<p>Lightning Cats</p>"},{"location":"teams/teams_fllc.html#fll-31404","title":"FLL 31404","text":"<p>Knight Gnomes</p>"},{"location":"teams/teams_fllc.html#fll-34195","title":"FLL 34195","text":"<p>Ping Pong Paladins</p>"},{"location":"teams/teams_flld.html","title":"Swerve FIRST LEGO League Discovery Teams","text":""},{"location":"teams/teams_flle.html","title":"Swerve FIRST LEGO League Explore Teams","text":""},{"location":"teams/teams_flle.html#fll-explore-5134-fll-explore-20375","title":"FLL Explore 5134 / FLL Explore 20375","text":"<p>Seven Wolves / Rainbow Dolphins</p>"},{"location":"teams/teams_ftc.html","title":"Swerve FIRST Tech Challenge Teams","text":""},{"location":"teams/teams_ftc.html#ftc-417","title":"FTC 417","text":"<p>S.K.I.D.
